The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
The choir of children sing their song
Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong, ding
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...
Do-do, do-do...
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
The word is out
About the town
So lift a glass
Wah, don't look down
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
The choir of children sing their song
They've practiced all year long
Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong, ding
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...
Do-do, do-do...
The party's on
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, Christmastime
