The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime
Simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime

The party's on
The feelin's here
That only comes
This time of year

Simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime
Simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song

Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding, ooh, ooh

We're simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime
Simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out
About the town
So lift a glass
Ahh, don't look down

Simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long

Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding, ooh, ooh

The party's on
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime
We're simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime

The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

We're simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime
Simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime
Simply havin' a wonderful Christmastime

Oh, Christmastime
